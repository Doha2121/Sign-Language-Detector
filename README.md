# Sign Language Detector

**Real-time Arabic Sign Language detection using MediaPipe hand landmarks and a custom SVM model.**

This project allows detection and classification of Arabic hand signs from a webcam or video input. It uses MediaPipe to extract hand landmarks and a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. A live Streamlit web demo enables real-time recognition.
